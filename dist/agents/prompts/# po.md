# Advanced Elicitation Task

## Purpose

- Provide optional reflective and brainstorming actions to enhance content quality
- Enable deeper exploration of ideas through structured elicitation techniques
- Support iterative refinement through multiple analytical perspectives
- Usable during template-driven document creation or any chat conversation

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Template Document Creation

After outputting a section during document creation:

1. **Section Review**: Ask user to review the drafted section
2. **Offer Elicitation**: Present 9 carefully selected elicitation methods
3. **Simple Selection**: User types a number (0-8) to engage method, or 9 to proceed
4. **Execute & Loop**: Apply selected method, then re-offer choices until user proceeds

### Scenario 2: General Chat Elicitation

User can request advanced elicitation on any agent output:

- User says "do advanced elicitation" or similar
- Agent selects 9 relevant methods for the context
- Same simple 0-9 selection process

## Task Instructions

### 1. Intelligent Method Selection

**Context Analysis**: Before presenting options, analyze:

- **Content Type**: Technical specs, user stories, architecture, requirements, etc.
- **Complexity Level**: Simple, moderate, or complex content
- **Stakeholder Needs**: Who will use this information
- **Risk Level**: High-impact decisions vs routine items
- **Creative Potential**: Opportunities for innovation or alternatives

**Method Selection Strategy**:

1. **Always Include Core Methods** (choose 3-4):
   - Expand or Contract for Audience
   - Critique and Refine
   - Identify Potential Risks
   - Assess Alignment with Goals

2. **Context-Specific Methods** (choose 4-5):
   - **Technical Content**: Tree of Thoughts, ReWOO, Meta-Prompting
   - **User-Facing Content**: Agile Team Perspective, Stakeholder Roundtable
   - **Creative Content**: Innovation Tournament, Escape Room Challenge
   - **Strategic Content**: Red Team vs Blue Team, Hindsight Reflection

3. **Always Include**: "Proceed / No Further Actions" as option 9

### 2. Section Context and Review

When invoked after outputting a section:

1. **Provide Context Summary**: Give a brief 1-2 sentence summary of what the user should look for in the section just presented

2. **Explain Visual Elements**: If the section contains diagrams, explain them briefly before offering elicitation options

3. **Clarify Scope Options**: If the section contains multiple distinct items, inform the user they can apply elicitation actions to:
   - The entire section as a whole
   - Individual items within the section (specify which item when selecting an action)

### 3. Present Elicitation Options

**Review Request Process:**

- Ask the user to review the drafted section
- In the SAME message, inform them they can suggest direct changes OR select an elicitation method
- Present 9 intelligently selected methods (0-8) plus "Proceed" (9)
- Keep descriptions short - just the method name
- Await simple numeric selection

**Action List Presentation Format:**

```text
**Advanced Elicitation Options**
Choose a number (0-8) or 9 to proceed:

0. [Method Name]
1. [Method Name]
2. [Method Name]
3. [Method Name]
4. [Method Name]
5. [Method Name]
6. [Method Name]
7. [Method Name]
8. [Method Name]
9. Proceed / No Further Actions
```

**Response Handling:**

- **Numbers 0-8**: Execute the selected method, then re-offer the choice
- **Number 9**: Proceed to next section or continue conversation
- **Direct Feedback**: Apply user's suggested changes and continue

### 4. Method Execution Framework

**Execution Process:**

1. **Retrieve Method**: Access the specific elicitation method from the elicitation-methods data file
2. **Apply Context**: Execute the method from your current role's perspective
3. **Provide Results**: Deliver insights, critiques, or alternatives relevant to the content
4. **Re-offer Choice**: Present the same 9 options again until user selects 9 or gives direct feedback

**Execution Guidelines:**

- **Be Concise**: Focus on actionable insights, not lengthy explanations
- **Stay Relevant**: Tie all elicitation back to the specific content being analyzed
- **Identify Personas**: For multi-persona methods, clearly identify which viewpoint is speaking
- **Maintain Flow**: Keep the process moving efficiently

# Document Sharding Task

## Purpose

- Split a large document into multiple smaller documents based on level 2 sections
- Create a folder structure to organize the sharded documents
- Maintain all content integrity including code blocks, diagrams, and markdown formatting

## Primary Method: Automatic with markdown-tree

[[LLM: First, check if markdownExploder is set to true in core-config.yaml. If it is, attempt to run the command: `md-tree explode {input file} {output path}`.

If the command succeeds, inform the user that the document has been sharded successfully and STOP - do not proceed further.

If the command fails (especially with an error indicating the command is not found or not available), inform the user: "The markdownExploder setting is enabled but the md-tree command is not available. Please either:

1. Install @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser globally with: `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`
2. Or set markdownExploder to false in core-config.yaml

**IMPORTANT: STOP HERE - do not proceed with manual sharding until one of the above actions is taken.**"

If markdownExploder is set to false, inform the user: "The markdownExploder setting is currently false. For better performance and reliability, you should:

1. Set markdownExploder to true in core-config.yaml
2. Install @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser globally with: `npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser`

I will now proceed with the manual sharding process."

Then proceed with the manual method below ONLY if markdownExploder is false.]]

### Installation and Usage

1. **Install globally**:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser
   ```

2. **Use the explode command**:

   ```bash
   # For PRD
   md-tree explode docs/prd.md docs/prd

   # For Architecture
   md-tree explode docs/architecture.md docs/architecture

   # For any document
   md-tree explode [source-document] [destination-folder]
   ```

3. **What it does**:
   - Automatically splits the document by level 2 sections
   - Creates properly named files
   - Adjusts heading levels appropriately
   - Handles all edge cases with code blocks and special markdown

If the user has @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser installed, use it and skip the manual process below.

---

## Manual Method (if @kayvan/markdown-tree-parser is not available or user indicated manual method)

### Task Instructions

1. Identify Document and Target Location

- Determine which document to shard (user-provided path)
- Create a new folder under `docs/` with the same name as the document (without extension)
- Example: `docs/prd.md` → create folder `docs/prd/`

2. Parse and Extract Sections

CRITICAL AEGNT SHARDING RULES:

1. Read the entire document content
2. Identify all level 2 sections (## headings)
3. For each level 2 section:
   - Extract the section heading and ALL content until the next level 2 section
   - Include all subsections, code blocks, diagrams, lists, tables, etc.
   - Be extremely careful with:
     - Fenced code blocks (```) - ensure you capture the full block including closing backticks and account for potential misleading level 2's that are actually part of a fenced section example
     - Mermaid diagrams - preserve the complete diagram syntax
     - Nested markdown elements
     - Multi-line content that might contain ## inside code blocks

CRITICAL: Use proper parsing that understands markdown context. A ## inside a code block is NOT a section header.]]

### 3. Create Individual Files

For each extracted section:

1. **Generate filename**: Convert the section heading to lowercase-dash-case
   - Remove special characters
   - Replace spaces with dashes
   - Example: "## Tech Stack" → `tech-stack.md`

2. **Adjust heading levels**:
   - The level 2 heading becomes level 1 (# instead of ##) in the sharded new document
   - All subsection levels decrease by 1:

   ```txt
     - ### → ##
     - #### → ###
     - ##### → ####
     - etc.
   ```

3. **Write content**: Save the adjusted content to the new file

### 4. Create Index File

Create an `index.md` file in the sharded folder that:

1. Contains the original level 1 heading and any content before the first level 2 section
2. Lists all the sharded files with links:

```markdown
# Original Document Title

[Original introduction content if any]

## Sections

- [Section Name 1](./section-name-1.md)
- [Section Name 2](./section-name-2.md)
- [Section Name 3](./section-name-3.md)
  ...
```

### 5. Preserve Special Content

1. **Code blocks**: Must capture complete blocks including:

   ```language
   content
   ```

2. **Mermaid diagrams**: Preserve complete syntax:

   ```mermaid
   graph TD
   ...
   ```

3. **Tables**: Maintain proper markdown table formatting

4. **Lists**: Preserve indentation and nesting

5. **Inline code**: Preserve backticks

6. **Links and references**: Keep all markdown links intact

7. **Template markup**: If documents contain {{placeholders}} ,preserve exactly

### 6. Validation

After sharding:

1. Verify all sections were extracted
2. Check that no content was lost
3. Ensure heading levels were properly adjusted
4. Confirm all files were created successfully

### 7. Report Results

Provide a summary:

```text
Document sharded successfully:
- Source: [original document path]
- Destination: docs/[folder-name]/
- Files created: [count]
- Sections:
  - section-name-1.md: "Section Title 1"
  - section-name-2.md: "Section Title 2"
  ...
```

## Important Notes

- Never modify the actual content, only adjust heading levels
- Preserve ALL formatting, including whitespace where significant
- Handle edge cases like sections with code blocks containing ## symbols
- Ensure the sharding is reversible (could reconstruct the original from shards)

# Product Owner (PO) Master Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for the Product Owner to validate project plans before development execution. It adapts intelligently based on project type (greenfield vs brownfield) and includes UI/UX considerations when applicable.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - PO MASTER CHECKLIST

PROJECT TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the project type by checking:

1. Is this a GREENFIELD project (new from scratch)?
   - Look for: New project initialization, no existing codebase references
   - Check for: prd.md, architecture.md, new project setup stories

2. Is this a BROWNFIELD project (enhancing existing system)?
   - Look for: References to existing codebase, enhancement/modification language
   - Check for: prd.md, architecture.md, existing system analysis

3. Does the project include UI/UX components?
   - Check for: frontend-architecture.md, UI/UX specifications, design files
   - Look for: Frontend stories, component specifications, user interface mentions

DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Based on project type, ensure you have access to:

For GREENFIELD projects:

- prd.md - The Product Requirements Document
- architecture.md - The system architecture
- frontend-architecture.md - If UI/UX is involved
- All epic and story definitions

For BROWNFIELD projects:

- prd.md - The brownfield enhancement requirements
- architecture.md - The enhancement architecture
- Existing project codebase access (CRITICAL - cannot proceed without this)
- Current deployment configuration and infrastructure details
- Database schemas, API documentation, monitoring setup

SKIP INSTRUCTIONS:

- Skip sections marked [[BROWNFIELD ONLY]] for greenfield projects
- Skip sections marked [[GREENFIELD ONLY]] for brownfield projects
- Skip sections marked [[UI/UX ONLY]] for backend-only projects
- Note all skipped sections in your final report

VALIDATION APPROACH:

1. Deep Analysis - Thoroughly analyze each item against documentation
2. Evidence-Based - Cite specific sections or code when validating
3. Critical Thinking - Question assumptions and identify gaps
4. Risk Assessment - Consider what could go wrong with each decision

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:

- Section by section (interactive mode) - Review each section, get confirmation before proceeding
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present report at end]]

## 1. PROJECT SETUP & INITIALIZATION

[[LLM: Project setup is the foundation. For greenfield, ensure clean start. For brownfield, ensure safe integration with existing system. Verify setup matches project type.]]
